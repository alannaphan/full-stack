  <h1>Detailed File Page</h1>
  <p>
    On this page, I would display the file that was clicked on from the PatientTable.vue component. <br>
    I would have retrieved the file reference link or downloadURL via the stored metadata in the Firestore Database <br>
    I would also display the comments that belonged to this file, with the ability to create and delete comments.<br>
    Additionally, after uploading a new file, it would redirect to this page right after.
